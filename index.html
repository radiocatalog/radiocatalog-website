        long-standing amateur radio software projects.

        <h2>What We're Doing</h2>
        <p>
          We are building a software catalog and creating version-controlled
          repositories to ensure these valuable projects remain accessible and
          relevant for the ham community. Our goal is to foster continued
          development and preserve history.
        </p>
        <p>
          We contact original authors to recover lost or hidden revisions of source
          code and provide a clean, maintainable archive for the amateur
          community.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Preserve project history using Git and the DLARC archive.</li>
          <li>Enable future development and iteration.</li>
          <li>Ensure compatibility with modern operating systems.</li>
